Hey everyone!

I'm Shawn and I currently work as a Quality Engineering Manager at Cash App in Block. My job responsibilities mostly cover automation, testing and exploratory testing on mobile platforms domain.

This blog is mainly created to document all the solutions I came to during my day-to-day work. Usually these things might be tricky to google and I truly hope they make someone else's life easier.

Don't hesitate to drop any thoughts or suggestions in the comment sections. Cheers! :beer:
